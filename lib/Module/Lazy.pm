=head1 NAME

Module::Lazy - postpone loading a module until it's actually used

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Module::Lazy "My::Module";
    # My::Module has not been loaded

    my $var = My::Module->new;
    # My::Module is loaded now, and new() method is called

    no Module::Lazy;
    # Force loading of all postponed modules

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In large projects loading all the dependencies may take a lot of time.
This module attempts to reduce the startup time by postponing initialization.
The improvement be significant for unit test scripts
and small command-line tools
which do not utilize all the functionality at once.

This comes at a cost of reduced stability,
as load-time errors are also postponed.
The C<no Module::Lazy> directive is provided to mitigate the risk
by forcing the pending modules to load.

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

None.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

use Carp;
use constant DEBUG => !!$ENV{PERL_LAZYLOAD_DEBUG};

=head2 import

When C<use Module::Lazy "Some::Module";> is called,
the module in question is not loaded.
A stub package with the same name is created instead.

Should any method call be performed on the stub package,
it loads the original one and jumps to respective method.

In particular, C<can()> and C<isa()> are overloaded
and will trigger module loading.

Upon loading, C<import> is not called on the target package.
This MAY change in the future.

No extra options (except from target module name) are allowed.

    #     without ever loading a module
    _set_symbol( $target, DESTROY => _jump( $target, DESTROY => "no_die" ) );

    # If somebody calls Module->can("foo"), we can't really tell
    # without loading, so override it

    _set_symbol( $target, VERSION => 10**9 );
};

=head2 unimport

Calling C<no Module::Lazy;> or, alternatively, C<Module::Lazy-E<gt>unimport;>
will cause all postponed modules to be loaded immediately,
in alphabetical order.

This may be useful to avoid deferred errors and/or side effects
of module loading.

No extra options to unimport are supported.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

If C<PERL_LAZYLOAD_DEBUG> is set and true,
warns about module loading via Carp.

If C<PERL_LAZYLOAD_DISABLE> is set and true,
don't try to lazyload anything - just go straight to C<require>.

(That's roughly equivalent to C<perl -M-Module::Lazy> on command line).

=head1 CAVEATS

=over

=item * The following symbols are currently replaced by stubs
in the module to be loaded: C<AUTOLOAD>, C<DESTROY>, C<can>, C<isa>.

=item * If a module was ever lazyloaded, a normal C<require> would do nothing.
A method must be called to inflate the module.

This is done so because a normal require would partially overwrite
stub methods and potentially wreak havoc.

=item * A fake $VERSION = 10**9 is generated so that C<use Module x.yy>
doesn't die. This value is erased before actually loading the module.

=back



=head1 BUGS

=over

=item * C<use mro 'c3';> does not work with lazy-loaded parent classes.

=item * C<import()> is not called on the modules being loaded.
The decision is yet to be made whether it's good or bad.

=item * no way to preload prototyped exported functions
(that's what L<autouse> does),
but maybe there should be?

=item * certainly not enough interoperability tests.

it does it for imported functions rather than methods.
