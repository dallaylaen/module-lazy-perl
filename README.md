on-demand

# NAME

on::demand - postpone loading a perl module until it's actually used

# USAGE

    use on::demand "My::Module";
    # the module is not required at this point, speeding up the startup

    my $new = My::Module->new;
    # My::Module is loaded now and real new() method is called

    no on::demand;
    # Force loading of all postponed modules, in alphabetical order

# DESCRIPTION

In a big project with large dependency footprint
loading modules may take quite a while.
This is not a problem for daemons or long-running apps.
However, time saving for simple command-line tools or test scripts
may be significant.
